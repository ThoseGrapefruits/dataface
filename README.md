# dataface
> Web-based human-evolved facial structure data, taking the concept of
[picbreeder](http://picbreeder.org/) and applying it to graphs of facial structure.

Final project for CS 3200, Spring 2017 @ Northeastern University.

__Based on the [neo4j-movies-haskell-bolt example](https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-movies-haskell-bolt) by [zmactep](https://github.com/zmactep)__.

Requirements
------------
- [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/downloads#platform)
- [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/community-edition/)
    + Run locally (will run on [`localhost:7474`](http://localhost:7474))
    + Set up user with username & password of `dataface`, or change [Main.hs](app/Main.hs)
      to match your existing username & password

Usage
-----
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ThoseGrapefruits/dataface.git
cd dataface
stack build
stack exec dataface-exe
```

Concept
-------
A web game Ã  la [picbreeder](http://picbreeder.org), in which users select from a random human
face structure (stored as a series of 2D points) and slight modifications to each new set of
provided structures allows larger changes to happen over time.

Goals
-----
- Use a NoSQL database (neo4j due to graph representation of faces).
- Use a functional language we haven't used before (Haskell).
- Make a product that requires some complexity above simple database interactions.
